# ML1-regression

This is a project containing a project done during my studies for Machine Learning 1 class with contributor and my BFF Ewelina.
It's a smaller dataset regression model.

Data can be found in /dataset folder
Analysis and model is in ML1-kod.ipynb jupyter notebook.

The goal of the model is to predict the number of violent crimes per community.
We mainly used linear regression as benchmark.
We also later did KNN prediction, but I don't think we updated the code...
