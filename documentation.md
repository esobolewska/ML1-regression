## Regression task (using small dataset)

**Subject:** 
Comparison of performance of KNN algorithm and linear regression - case of violent crimes commited in different communities within the United States.

**Source of dataset:** 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime

**Description of dataset:** 
The dataset combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.

**Description of analysed problem:** 
Predicting total number of violent crimes (variable ViolentCrimesPerPop) using a set of variables chosen using feature selection methods.


## Classification task (using large dataset)

**Subject:**  Predicting the type of the forest using 

**Source of data:** 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype

**Description of dataset:** 

We will limit the target variable to only two levels indicating whether the forest is pine or not.

**Description of analysed problem:** 
Predicting forest cover type using different machine learning algorithms, that is SVM, KNN and logistic regression.
